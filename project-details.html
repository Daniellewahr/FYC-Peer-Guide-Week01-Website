            McGilleats is an app idea for McGill residence dining halls. Members of the 
            McGill community will be able to see the menus of each dining hall through this app.
            In addition, they will be able to post reviews on their meals, submit their requests to the staff, 
            or show their appreciation. This will create a better dining hall experience for students and staff.
